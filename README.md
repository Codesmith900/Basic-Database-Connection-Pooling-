# Basic-Database-Connection-Pooling

A database connection pool is a cache of reusable database connections managed by an application or middleware. It addresses the overhead associated with frequently establishing and closing database connections, which can be resource-intensive and impact application performance.

When a query is executed, it borrows a connection from the pool, performs the query, and then releases the connection back to the pool for reuse. The pool takes care of managing and reusing connections, which helps improve the efficiency and performance of database interactions in the application.
